# The following asset file is generated by ITwinCesiumRuntime module when launching Carrot in Editor mode for the first time - see UITwinCesiumIonServer::GetDefaultServer().
# If this file is missing - such as when generating a package within ADO pipeline - the app will crash due to a failure to initialize the Cesium server.
# Since this asset is machine-independent and remains unchanged after creation, it has now been added directly to the repository to prevent initialization issues.
