# itwin-unreal-plugin

## Overview
The iTwin for Unreal plugin enables streaming of iTwins and reality data from the iTwin cloud into Unreal Engine for high-fidelity visualization and consumption. The plugin and its built-in blureprint API allows Unreal Engine developers to create custom applications which can expand upon the capabilities provided by the plugin out of the box. This enables the creation of tailored interactive experiences around iTwins. In addition, we provide the source code of the plugin for developers who would like to compile the plugin themselves.<br>
The streaming technology is based on the open-source [Cesium 3D tiles] (https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium) and offers great performance even with large datasets.<br>  
This plugin will be regularly updated. We appreciate your feedback to turn this exciting new technology into the leading foundation for advanced visualization of Digital Twins leveraging game engine technology. We encourage you to participate in the plugin's development with your ideas, requests and wishes, and help us shape the future of visualization together. <br>
