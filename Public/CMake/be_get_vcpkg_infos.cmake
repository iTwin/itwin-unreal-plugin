# The goal of this script is to retrieve informations about the vcpkg packages we use.
# Such informations are:
# - the list of packages we use
# - for each package, the list of its dependencies
# - for each package, the list of its source and lib files.
# Retrieveing these infos involves running some vcpkg commands and parse their output.
# Parsing is much simpler in python than in CMake, so what we do is run a python script
# that does all the job and generates files that are used to set CMake variables,
# which can be used later eg. in be_add_unreal_project().
# For example, the list of dependencies of package catch2 will be written by the python script
# to a file named "DEPENDENCIES_catch2", whose content is then set to a CMake variable named
# BE_VCPKG_DEPENDENCIES_catch2.
