		//! This means that even if 2 faces have different gltf materials but their element ID belongs
		//! to the same group, they will be merged into the same primitive.
		//! Besides anim4D, merging can still be prevented in these cases:
		//! - primitives do not have the same topology (eg. we cannot merge lines and triangles,
		//!   but we can merge triangle lists and triangle strips, as strips are converted to lists),
		//! - primitives do not have the same attribute list (eg. primitive 1 has UVs, but not primitive 2).
		//! Note that 2 MaterialGroup's with identical material_ and itwinMaterialID_ members are still
		//! different groups and that must prevent merging.

		};
		//! The list of element groups.
		//! Elements belonging to different groups (material or anim4D groups) cannot be merged together.
		//! All Elements not contained in any group can be merged together, as long as the primitives have
		//! same topology, same material, same attribute list.
		//! An Element can belong to a single material group (as opposed to anim4Ds)
		std::vector<MaterialGroup> materialGroups_;
		//! iTwin material IDs to split (when the user wants to edit/replace materials, typically)

		{
			std::vector<uint64_t> elements_; ///< IDs of Elements in this group
			//! Identifier of the 4D animation "group" to which the Elements refer: see anim4DGroups_ below
			Anim4DId ids_;
		};
		//! Elements must be assigned to distinct anim4D "groups" when they cannot be merged together,
		//! because either:
		//!	 * they don't have the same material translucency requirement (only 4D-related, I guess the
		//!	   original material's translucency depends on each ClusterId::material_),
		//!  * or they have different transformation requirements (either none, or one or more task/3Dpath
		//!    assignments)
		//!
		//! This means that all Elements that need to be made translucent _and_ have no transformation can
		//! be put in the same group (much more efficient than the previous extraction method btw).
		//! To investigate severe flickering artifacts (even with alpha=1) when large meshes intertwine
		//! with all other non-translucent meshes, an option has been added to customize the rules, so
		//! we are actually able to use unlimited (per tile!) grouping of translucent Elements, or to
		//! limit grouping per common set of translucent timelines, or to isolate translucent Elements
		//! individually, like with the legacy extraction method. Even though in the end the flickering
		//! does not seem related to tuning, since in fact only extracted meshes do not flicker, all
		//! others do, even untuned gltf meshes...
		//!
		//! For Elements which need to be transformable, we will use as "group Id" the list of the indices
		//! (in FITwinScheduleTimeline's container) of the transform-needing timelines they belong to.
		//! Usually there will be only one, but Elements can refer to several timelines, when belonging to
		//! several transformed resources, or to a transformed resource assigned to different tasks along
		//! with other resources.
		//! Note that anim4DGroups_ will never change (at least with Legacy schedules), hence the separate
		//! SetAnim4DRules method to avoid rebuilding the multimap everytime a material is edited :/
